- title: "Master’s Thesis — Choquet Fuzzy Integral Based Ensemble Learning for Credit Score Modelling"
  context: "Supervisor: Mr. Tawfik Ben Amor (ESEN). The project addresses the rigidity of traditional credit scoring by composing neural and boosting models, then fusing predictions through the Choquet fuzzy integral to account for model interdependencies."
  stack: "Ensemble Learning, Neural Networks, Boosting Models, Choquet Fuzzy Integral"
  outcomes: "The hybrid approach improved performance over standalone models by approximately 6% and exceeded statistical baselines by approximately 25% on real financial datasets, with careful visualization and validation."
